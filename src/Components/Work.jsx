          Built during the group project phase of the Northcoders bootcamp,
          2Gather is a full-stack React Native app designed to help users
          connect through one-on-one events. Users can sign up, host their own
          events, and request to join others'. The app is built with React
          Native, Fastify, and PostgreSQL (via Supabase), featuring Base64 image
          handling for efficient uploads and a seamless cross-platform
          experience. Developed collaboratively using agile methodologies and
          GitHub for version control.
